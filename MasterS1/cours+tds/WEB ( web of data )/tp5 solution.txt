a. This query selects mountains located in Algeria and retrieves their elevations.
b. The "a" in the pattern "?m a dbo:Mountain;" corresponds to the "rdf:type" property in the RDF triple pattern. It's being substituted with the URI of the type "dbo:Mountain."
c. The "dbo:" prefix corresponds to the DBpedia ontology, and the "dbr:" prefix corresponds to DBpedia resources.
d. The execution of the query will retrieve the mountains located in Algeria and their elevations. The result obtained should match the expected mountains' elevations.

To obtain the URIs and altitudes of the ten highest peaks in Algeria, you can use the following query:

SELECT ?m ?a 
WHERE {
 ?m a dbo:Mountain;
 dbo:locatedInArea dbr:Algeria;
 dbo:elevation ?a.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?a)
LIMIT 10
To also get the names of the peaks along with their altitudes, you can use the following query:
SELECT ?m ?a ?label
WHERE {
 ?m a dbo:Mountain;
 dbo:locatedInArea dbr:Algeria;
 rdfs:label ?label;
 dbo:elevation ?a.
 FILTER (lang(?label) = 'en')
}
ORDER BY DESC(?a)
LIMIT 10
a. This query retrieves only the peaks with English labels. The number of different peaks obtained depends on how many have English labels.
b. To get the English names only, modify the last query by removing the selection of the label in a specific language.

To obtain the altitude and English names of all Algerian peaks over 2000m in descending order, you can use the following query:
SELECT ?m ?a ?label
WHERE {
 ?m a dbo:Mountain;
 dbo:locatedInArea dbr:Algeria;
 rdfs:label ?label;
 dbo:elevation ?a.
 FILTER (?a > 2000)
 FILTER (lang(?label) = 'en')
}
ORDER BY DESC(?a)
b. To get the number of peaks found, you can use the following query:

SELECT (COUNT(?m) as ?count)
WHERE {
 ?m a dbo:Mountain;
 dbo:locatedInArea dbr:Algeria;
 dbo:elevation ?a.
 FILTER (?a > 2000)
}
To retrieve the URIs, altitudes, English names, and Arabic names of peaks over 2000m, sorted by altitude in descending order, you can use the following query:
SELECT ?m ?a ?en_label ?ar_label
WHERE {
 ?m a dbo:Mountain;
 dbo:locatedInArea dbr:Algeria;
 rdfs:label ?en_label;
 dbo:elevation ?a.
 OPTIONAL {
  ?m rdfs:label ?ar_label.
  FILTER (lang(?ar_label) = 'ar')
 }
 FILTER (?a > 2000) 
 FILTER (lang(?en_label) = 'en')
}
ORDER BY DESC(?a)

SELECT ?m ?a ?en_label ?ru_label
WHERE {
 ?m a dbo:Mountain;
 dbo:locatedInArea dbr:Algeria;
 rdfs:label ?en_label;
 dbo:elevation ?a.
 OPTIONAL {
  ?m rdfs:label ?ru_label.
  FILTER (lang(?ru_label) = 'ru')
 }
 FILTER (?a > 2000) 
 FILTER (lang(?en_label) = 'en')
}
ORDER BY DESC(?a)










exo 2:


SELECT ?p
WHERE {
  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assia_Djebar> ?p ?o.
  FILTER (strstarts(str(?p), "http://dbpedia.org/ontology"))
}
ORDER BY asc(?p)
You can also try this query with and without DISTINCT to check the difference in results.

The following SPARQL query retrieves the date of birth and the place of birth of the writer:
SELECT ?birthdate ?birthplace
WHERE {
  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assia_Djebar> dbo:birthDate ?birthdate;
                                            dbo:birthPlace ?birthplace.
}
The following ASK query helps determine whether Assia Djebar is deceased or not:
ASK
WHERE {
  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assia_Djebar> dbo:deathDate ?deathdate.
}
This query retrieves the type of the resource Assia Djebar and determines the most appropriate type from the DBpedia ontology:
SELECT ?type
WHERE {
  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assia_Djebar> a ?type.
  FILTER (strstarts(str(?type), "http://dbpedia.org/ontology"))
}
Based on the types returned, the most appropriate type from the DBpedia ontology for indicating that Assia Djebar is a writer could be dbo:Writer.

To determine the number of writers in DBpedia, you can use the following query:
SELECT (COUNT(?person) as ?count)
WHERE {
  ?person a dbo:Writer.
}
The number of writers found in DBpedia will be based on the count obtained from this query.

To refine the previous query to retrieve only the writers born in Algeria, you can use the following query:
SELECT (COUNT(?person) as ?count)
WHERE {
  ?person a dbo:Writer;
          dbo:birthPlace <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algeria>.
}
This will give you the count of writers born in Algeria in DBpedia.

i need it with dbr:

Certainly! If you want to retrieve the information using the resource identifier prefix "dbr" instead of the full URLs, here are the modified queries:

List of properties of the writer Assia Djebar:
SELECT ?p
WHERE {
  dbr:Assia_Djebar ?p ?o.
  FILTER (strstarts(str(?p), "http://dbpedia.org/ontology"))
}
ORDER BY asc(?p)
Date of birth and place of birth of the writer:
SELECT ?birthdate ?birthplace
WHERE {
  dbr:Assia_Djebar dbo:birthDate ?birthdate;
                  dbo:birthPlace ?birthplace.
}
ASK query to determine if Assia Djebar is deceased:
ASK
WHERE {
  dbr:Assia_Djebar dbo:deathDate ?deathdate.
}
Query to find the type of the resource Assia Djebar within the DBpedia ontology:
SELECT ?type
WHERE {
  dbr:Assia_Djebar a ?type.
  FILTER (strstarts(str(?type), "http://dbpedia.org/ontology"))
}
Query to determine the number of writers in DBpedia:
SELECT (COUNT(?person) as ?count)
WHERE {
  ?person a dbo:Writer.
}
Query to find the number of writers born in Algeria:
SELECT (COUNT(?person) as ?count)
WHERE {
  ?person a dbo:Writer;
          dbo:birthPlace dbr:Algeria.
